what type of relationship is there between pets and owners table?
a: one owner to many pets based on the table structure. an owner can have many pets but a pet can only have one owner based on table structure.

we make a new table called addresses to go with the owners table. what type of relationship is this?
--I think this can be a many to many with a junction table since there is no foreign key in their example. yep. it can get this complex but it could also be one to one..

in a spotify database, there's songs, playlists, and users tables. What's the relationship types between these tables?
playlists->users = many playlists to one user
songs->playists = many to many
